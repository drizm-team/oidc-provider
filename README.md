## About OpenID

OpenID Connect is a simple identity
layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol,
which allows computing clients to
verify the identity of an end-user
based on the authentication performed
by an authorization server,
as well as to obtain basic profile
information about the end-user in an
interoperable and REST-like manner.
Like [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)
for example.
